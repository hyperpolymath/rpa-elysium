== Technical Decisions

=== Why These Technologies?

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Decision |Rationale

|*Rust for core*
|Performance, safety, WASM compilation, no GC pauses

|*ReScript for UI*
|Type safety, clean JS output, React compatibility

|*Gleam for backend*
|BEAM reliability, functional purity, actor model

|*Deno for runtime*
|Security-first, modern APIs, no node_modules

|*Guix for packaging*
|Reproducible builds, declarative configuration

|*No Python/Node*
|Avoid dependency hell, prefer compiled languages
|===

=== Architecture Principles

1. *Modular* — Each component is independently deployable
2. *Type-safe* — Strong typing at all layers
3. *Observable* — Rich metrics, logs, and traces
4. *Resilient* — Graceful degradation and recovery
5. *Portable* — Runs on Linux, macOS, Windows
6. *FOSS* — No proprietary dependencies
